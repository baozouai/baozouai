致疯狂的人：

他们特立独行，他们桀骜不驯，他们惹事生非，他们格格不入，他们用与众不同的眼光看待事物。

他们不喜欢墨守成规。他们也不安于现状。你可以认同他们，反对他们，颂扬或是诋毁他们。但唯独不能漠视他们。因为他们改变了寻常事物。他们推动人类向前迈进。

或许他们是别人眼里的疯子，但他们却是我们眼中的天才。因为只有那些**疯狂到以为自己能够改变世界的人，才能真正改变世界**

Here's to the crazy ones.

The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.

They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. 

And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because **the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world,are the ones who do**
